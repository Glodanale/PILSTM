Step 1:  
Action:     Convert metrics in original dataset and reduce columns to only what is needed
File:       1_ReduceConvertI80.ipynb
Output:     ngsim_i_80 table in mysql

Step 2:
Action:     Restructure dataset with associations.  Save as csv file
File:       2_processI80.sql
Output:     2_processedI80.csv

Step 3:
Action:     Move the restructured data into mysql
File:       3_sendToSQL.py
Output:     i_80_processed table in mysql

Step 4:
Action:     Run initial architecture to weed out outlier sequences
File:       4_ProcessLossResults.py
Output:     4_ReportLoss.csv

Step 5:
Action:     Order the rows of sequence loss data by MSEc (computational graph)
            Assign percentile values
File:       ReportLoss.csv
Output:     None

Step 6:
Action:     Store the identification values for sequences with a MSEc loss percentile value above 0.95
File:       6_writeListTotxt.py
Output:     6_largeLoss.txt

Step 7:
Action:     Extract the sequences from the restructured data except the sequences in 6_largeLoss.txt
File:       7_createNewDataset.py
Output:     ExperimentSet.csv
